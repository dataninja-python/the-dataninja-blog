# FIRST DAY BACK STRUGGLE
It took a while to get into the learning plan. Issue #1 is the hedge fund required a lot of attention today. Apparently, I was not the only one who sees the potential downward spiral resulting from hitting the debt ceiling.
Unfortunately, a few positions played counter to analysis. This should correct itself in time but in the short-term I had to make several adjustments.

By the time that was done, I had to handle several business calls. In short, I'm just sitting down now at 17:45 to learn. While I'm tempted to give up, I'm going to complete at least 1 Go exercise before returning to my front-end work.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS
Today, there's only one: start your day with the learning plan. This way even if work and other activities take more time than expected I can still recap what I learned earlier in the day.
