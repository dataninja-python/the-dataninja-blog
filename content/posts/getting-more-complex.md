# WE'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE
Ok. Going through "Go By Example" is boring. Really boring. It's probably the right this to do. But, I'm struggling with the fact that there are like 100 examples of things to do...and I've finished 19.

## PUSHING THROUGH
I'm not giving up. Far from it. I'm going to have to adjust how I do things to survive the monotony. So, how about this?

I'll split my time in half. The first part of my study time each day will be dedicated to going through examples. During the second, I'll start working on this poker game.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
Just one. Success requires constantly adapting to the situation. And, this situation is boring me to death. In the past, this would have been where I quit. But, thanks to publicly announcing my plans on this blog, I have to finish. HOW I motivate myself to finish is the trick.

## I'M OUT
Seriously, I'm out.
