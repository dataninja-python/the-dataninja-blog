# NEW MICRO-HABIT
Hi to whomever is still following along with this crazy journey. As is no doubt evident from the posts so far, I haven't determined the best way to use this blog. So, I hope it's ok if we go back to middle school science fair projects and use the good old scientific method.

# HYPOTHESIS
I believe that regularly documenting what I'm working on will improve my ability to do the small routine tasks that build up to longer term goals.

# THE EXPERIMENT
This blog - it turns out - is an excellent way to test my hypothesis. How? Well:

1. I need to write quarterly goals
2. I need break them down into monthly, weekly, and daily actions
3. I need to complete the daily actions and revise as needed

# THE CONCLUSION
With this new approach, this blog's purpose becomes clearer: document my goal achieving journey and try to make it entertaining enough for you to read.

Might as well get started.

## QUARTERLY GOALS
1. Launch kickseconomy.com
2. Automate the easiest part of hedge fund management
3. Prepare myself to pursue a master's degree

## MAY 31, 2023 ACTIONS
[] Finish React coding refresher
<br>
[] Complete 3 sections of Go By Example tutorial
<br>
[] Read Chapter 10 of "A Linear Algebra Primer for Financial Engineering"

# LATER
Check back this evening to see what I did and what I learned.
