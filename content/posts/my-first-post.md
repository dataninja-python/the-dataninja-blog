It's official. The internet is trash! Like GARBAGE!

After nearly four decades perfected the Art known known as "Googlefu." I seriously though we were in a new age.
An age where all information is milliseconds away. ChatGpt and other "AI" tools (we'll save my thoughts on this for another day)
are suppoed to make this even easier, right? Wrong!

So far, the internet has helped me find whole new ways to procrastinate. Here's what I've accomplished so far:

1. Created the 1st blog
2. Made the 1st post
3. Excitedly told my 2 mentors and a bunch of my friends about the blog and my desire to have them use it hold me accountable
4. Realized I had just made an ass of myself because the blog wasn't updating to show my posts
5. Mistakenly deleted the 1st blog trying to fix it
6. Mistakenly deleted the 2nd blog trying to use a backup of the 1st blog
7. Purposely deleted the 3rd blog

If you're reading this, then you can be certain of a few things:

* I have wasted nearly 10 hours that should have been invested in learning Go into setting up the Blog to keep me focused on
learing Go.

* I've given up on all these fake guru tutorials and blog posts and going directly to github's documentation...duh!

* I'm already pissed off and already feeling a little defeated
