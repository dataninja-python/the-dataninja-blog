It's official. The internet is trash! Like GARBAGE!

After nearly decades perfecting the martial art now known as "Googlefu." I seriously thought I could find anything...
...in milliseconds. Well, that's not true. And, ChatGpt and other "AI" tools (we'll save my thoughts on this for another day)
are suppoed to make this even easier, right? Wrong!

So far, all the internet has helped me do during the first week of publishing this blog is find whole new ways to procrastinate. 

Here's what I've actually "accomplished" so far:

1. Found a promising tutorial
2. Completed it 
3. Created the 1st blog
4. Made the 1st post
5. Excitedly told my 2 mentors and a bunch of my friends about the blog and my desire to have them use it hold me accountable
6. Wrote a 2nd post about how this was such a great idea
7. Realized I #failed because the damn blog isn't updating
8. Mistakenly deleted the 1st blog trying to fix it with a backup
9. Mistakenly deleted the 2nd blog and the backup trying to fix it
10. Purposely deleted the 3rd blog during a fit of rage after realizing deleting blogs is the one thing I for sure know how to do

If you're reading this, then you can be certain of a few things:

* I have wasted nearly 10 hours initially intended to be invested in learning Golang on this blog.

* I've realized most of these tutorials are by fake gurus who know less than me but had the audacity to create tutorials.

* I'm already pissed off, tired, and feeling a little defeated.


KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. Don't fall for hype. Just because a tutorial has a lot of views doesn't mean the content is useful, relevent, or, honestly,
even entertaining.

2. When in doubt, refer to the official documentation. As the Grey Poupon commercials say: "anything else would be uncivilized"

3. Buckle up. This is going to be one wild ride. Probably fun for you. But definitely a trying one for me. Guess I'll add patience
to the list of things I need to improve. {Internal Dialog: "Where are the random sheets of copy paper I jot notes on? Oh that's right.
I threw them away while 'cleaning up.' Great!"}

Join next week as our favorite nerd, anti-hero, and ADHDer makes his first post about actual coding. Or don't. F**@# it. I'm worn out.
