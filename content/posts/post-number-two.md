# TODAY WAS A 'W'

I'm proud to say I did it. I beat procrastination. I know, I know, it's a miracle. But it's true.

I had a full day of meetings today - usually the perfect excuse to not get anything done. But not today. Today, I won the productivity battle...we'll see about the war.

## THE PLAN

Here's how I did it:

* I got up early (7:30am - it hurt).
* I put down enough caffeine to kill a baby whale (don't judge).
* I mixed in building an actual project with my go-by-example tutorial work through.

What did I build? My own task manager. (To be fair, it's essentially a clone of a program called Task Warrior - see the end of the post.) It helped me track what I wanted to do and progress.

Well, the caffeine has given me a headache. So, that's it. Another day, I might dive into how I created TaskArchon (cool name?).

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. Even a broken watch is right twice a day. There are not enough data points for me to declare victory. But, as Ice Cube said: "Today was a good day." I guess just keep trying is the real lesson.

2. Early to rise and early to caffeinate. I attribute 80% of my productivity to Coca-Cola and 20% to getting up at 7:30am. No discussion. I stand by this message.

3. Build something. My mentors have both told me this for a while. Well, it turns out experts are...experts. Having something to build was motivating and helped me feel productive.

## I'M OUT!
See you next time. Same bat place. Probably not the same bat time because I'm horrible at keeping routines.

Please don't sue me. I'm just trying to learn to code.
