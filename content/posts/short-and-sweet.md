# THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE A TWEET
I didn’t do the best job blogging last week. Sure I had excuses. But, excuses != progress. So, here's my second post this weekend to catch up.

Though, to be honest, it is the weekend. Motivation is running low. And, I may have cracked opened a Playstation 5. One of the two, I am supposed to give away when we launch our upcoming retail app. 

That didn't help because it's calling me right now.

Before I go, here's my update: I simplified my Golang study plan. First, I’m going through the gobyexample.com website. Then, I’ll build a full project. Right now, I want to make a Texas Hold 'Em Poker game.

The vision is to code the intensive parts, odds calculator, etc, in Go. And, put it in a container. Then, use Elixir to build a server in the same container.  Elixir is great at building quick, easy to maintain, fault tolerant distributed apps. Go is great at building concurrent, compiled small footprint apps.

Together, I can set up the container on Digital Ocean. Build a good looking HTML, CSS, and Javascript Desktop app, like Discord or Slack, using Electron.js.

Then, my friends and I can use this to play friendly games of Poker anywhere in the world whenever we want.

However, this all starts with mastering Go. Follow along on my journey at this github:

## I'M OUT
That’s all I’ve got today. Let’s see if I can maintain a better blogging schedule this week. In the spirit of poker, I'm giving 1.25-to-1 odds I can post 4 times this week. 

That's an implied probability of ~56%. What do you say? Would you take the bet?

Well, off to play playstation…I mean rest.
