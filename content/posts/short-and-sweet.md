# THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE A TWEET
I didn't do the best job last week of blogging so I had to try to catch up. But, let's be honest its the weekend so my motivation is lacking. Plus, I made the mistake of opening one of the Playstations I was supposed to be giving away during an upcoming app launch...big mistake.

Anyway, there is something of value to report. I simplified how I'm learning Golang. I'm going through the gobyexample.com website. Then, I'll make a cool project. I'm leaning towards a simple texas hold 'em console game right now. Let's see if this urge lasts.

To follow along with my version of the examples, here's a link: https://github.com/dataninja-python/go-by-example.git

## I'M OUT
That's all I've got today. Let's see if I can maintain a better blogging schedule this week. I give it 1.25-to-1 odds. Yeah, ~56% implied probability sounds about right. Obviously, I have hedge fund on the brain but that's a story for another day. Off to play playstation...I mean rest.
