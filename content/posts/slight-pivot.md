# REFINING THE VISION
Ok. So, this is probably 55% ADHD and 45% learning what I didn't know talking. It appears in the end it will take multiple technologies working together to achieve my goal. What does this mean? Well, not much actually. Because Go is still going to be at the heart of executing a lot of the work.

## WHAT DOES CHANGE
* Python - ease of launch: going to have to use this more than I thought to handle a lot of the user account and similar backend activities.

* Elixir - ease of scaling: adding this to allow us to maintain the application with a very small team. This language is the successor to a language used to write a program that nearly never went down over decades of operation. We need that type of write and forget it reliability.

* Haskell - ease of security: I already hear the moaning from every senior engineer out these. You see Haskell is called an "academic" language because it is used mostly by...academics. But, there's no competition if you need to write something that is mathematically provably accurate. Now, like everything else garbage in = garbage out, so you better have clean data, know some advanced math, be good at algorithmic modelling, and keep testing for flaws - just in case.

* Rust - ease of secure speed: last is for the day we need to really need to scale. Like when we need C++ level speed. Then, we'll bring in the BFG of the technology stack...Rust.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
This is really a brainstorming post. I am working through my Go plan to make sure I understand it much deeper than when I learned it a couple of years ago (and it didn't stick because I didn't use it everyday). But, now you know, I've got years of material to blog about. Hell, I haven't even posted what I'm re-learning Go to build. Nor, my rants about "AI." Or, my hobby languages I use a lot on the side.

## I'M OUT
That's it for this post. I was going to start working on the poker game but work calls. Instead, I'm building and testing a mini waiting list app. I'll make an update later today or tomorrow.
