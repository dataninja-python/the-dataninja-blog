# DOWN BUT NOT OUT
Took a short break from blogging as I worked on a few other things (and the new diablo 4 game came out). However, I'm back and running through the Go By Example content (track my progress: https://github.com/dataninja-python/go-by-example.git).

# LEARNED SO FAR
This is my first attempt to learn a programming language only going through its official tutorial. It is less exciting than my usual way of building projects. However, I believe it is a better long-term approach because I should understand the language as the creators intended before applying the concepts.

Right now, I'm working through concurrency. Specifically, how Go uses channels, goroutines, and workers to perform many tasks at once.

Go's built-in concurrency functionality is a primary reason I added it to Kicks Economy's technology stack. Kicks Economy is a sneaker social media and services platform I'm developing (more information coming soon).

# I'M OUT
Thanks for sticking with me as I struggle to get into a blogging rhythm. The good news is my learning progress is going much better. Until next time, have a good day and remember to never stop learning.
