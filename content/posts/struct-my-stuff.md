# SLOWLY BUT SURELY
It's boring at times but I am making my way through the content. Go has an interesting data type called "structs." The appear similar to classes in Python, Javascript, and couple of other languages I've worked with.

However, implementing them is different. Structs hold data. Then, you can use other data structures to do things with the data. For example, methods allow you to perform actions with the data. Interfaces allow you to group methods together.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS
Go initially appears easy to read like Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Scheme. However, some features, such as pointers, structs, interfaces, etc, are more complex. I think I'll try to build something tomorrow to test how well I understand the concepts. Because right now it feels fuzzy.

#I'M OUT
Thanks all folks. Let's see if a quick project gives me more to say tomorrow.
