TLDR
1. My Opinion Doesn't Invalidate Others. To me, Angular is better than React. Considering 75% of tech firms use React, I'm obviously in the minority. Yet, I am entitled to my opinion just as everyone else is. Happily, people have approached my stance surprisingly well. Likely, because inside we know regardless of what tools we choose they all have problems.


2. Do What Works.
3. Meta's License Is A Concern.


MY OPINION IS MY OWN. YOURS CAN AND PROBABLY WILL VARY.
Who my opinion is not for?
* Someone new to programming
* Someone looking for a job
* Someone doing a quick thing

Who my opinion best suits?
* Someone who knows a few non-interpreted languages
* Someone accustomed to middle and backend system development
* Someone who gets pleasure from challenges
  * 10+ languages and growing
  * Data Science from Mathematics up
  * Writing my own language
* Obsessed with how things work
* Likes building things from scratch

30% of this is driven by, as a former C++ developer, I probably just like structured but complex over the alternative. 80% of this is driven by the fact I spend most of my time architecting and building the middle and backend portion of systems. Here a bit more upfront waterfall planning to increase: security, adaptability, and ease of maintenance often trumps the current speed first implementation of agile planning.


USE CASE MATTERS. USE THE BEST TOOL FOR THE JOB.
* As mentioned above, if you're not the type of person described you should already be leaning towards something more like React, Vue, Svelte, or others.


THE FINE PRINT MATTERS. META'S LICENSE ALONE IS ENOUGH TO DISQUALIFY REACT FOR ME.
