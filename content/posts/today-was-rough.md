# NOT ONE OF MY FINEST...

What can I say? There are no excuses. I just wasn't productive today. To be fair, I DID a lot of stuff. Just didn't spend much time on any of the important stuff long-term.

# THE WINNER IS WHO GETS UP LAST

I could beat myself up about it. Or, accept it. I didn't have a good day. I don't have a cool new program or update to share. So, here's the plan. Call it a night. Get up early. Try again. Mathematically speaking, if I keep doing that, I have to have another amazing day like yesterday.

NOTE: On a positive note, the fund had a good day. Too bad I didn't advance the skills needed to automate the strategies I'm currently employing manually.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. Keep expectations low...ankle level is best. Yesterday screwed me up. It led me to believe I'd be able to bang out a fully functional, usable program in the language I'm learning everyday. Not realistic I know. But, that's what I felt.

2. This is a marathon...that I'm treating like a sprint. The reality is learning things takes time. Why do I think I had to spend four years in college to get a Finance degree, 2 months in a data science bootcamp to pick up the basics, 3 months in a software engineering bootcamp to pick up fullstack development, but I'm going to learn a whole new language in a week or two? Not realistic.

3. Sleep is the answer. Americans work too much. And, I'm guilty of it too. Running the math, I've been working for ~15 hours. That's not healthy. Time to adopt a more European outlook and seek some work-life balance (until I have another good day and get uber excited again).

# I'M OUT
Anyway, that's it. I'm outta here. For all of our sakes, I've got to get something done tomorrow before I start getting discouraged. Ah, the joys of knowing your ADHD issues...sucks...but real. LOL.

NOTE: forgive any typos, poor grammar, etc. Some of it was likely because I had no Fs to give. The rest are because I'm tired. If I get time, I'll edit this post another day.
