<h2 id="when-life-gives-you-an-lmake-lemondade">WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU AN L&hellip;MAKE LEMONDADE</h2>
<p>Life is a journey filled with ups and downs, and sometimes, a single week can throw a series of unexpected challenges your way. This week was filled with personal and academic setbacks. However, I instead of disrupting my journey it has rekindled my drive to prove that we can achieve goals others deem impossible.</p>
<h2 id="loss-and-disappointment">LOSS AND DISAPPOINTMENT:</h2>
<p>One of the hardest challenges encountered this week was the news that a friend lost a family member. My condolences go out to him and his family because this is one of the greatest pains anyone can feel. It reminded me of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing our loved ones while we can. It also reminded me how short life is. Too short to let what you can or can&rsquo;t do be defined by others.</p>
<p>This was well timed because I also received the disappointing news that I was not accepted into the masters program I had applied to. It was disheartening to learn that my efforts didn&rsquo;t yield the desired outcome. However, setbacks are inevitable. And, as a life long entrepreneur forced to overcome numerous obstacles I knew this journey would not be easy either.</p>
<h2 id="refining-the-focus">REFINING THE FOCUS:</h2>
<p>Rather than dwell on the setback or listen to naysayers, because they mean well, I decided to adjust my approach. Perhaps I have been going about this the wrong way, while successfully running a hedge fund, I have built a great team and am learning another language to improve our infrastructure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been behaving as though I am in need of something to achieve my goals. Now, I&rsquo;m going to start proving I can achieve my goals and attract academic and other opportunities to me.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS:</h2>
<p>While this week was filled with difficulties, it reminded me how much I love a challenge. The have provided the fuel needed to do extraordinary things in my life. It has been a while since I have been doubted. Honestly, it feels good to have something to prove again. Game on!</p>
<p>Oh, and the hedge fund is up. Way up. So, perhaps I don&rsquo;t meet the requirements for some academic programs. But, unless this is dumb luck that I&rsquo;ve managed to pull off on two separate occassions now - which hey maybe it is, I seem to have a knack for capitalizing on security mispricings. Let&rsquo;s see if the streak continues as we formalize, automate, and add AI to the platform.</p>
