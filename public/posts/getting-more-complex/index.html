<p>Ok. Going through &ldquo;Go By Example&rdquo; is boring. Really boring. It&rsquo;s probably the right this to do. But, I&rsquo;m struggling with the fact that there are like 100 examples of things to do&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve finished 19.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-through">PUSHING THROUGH</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not giving up. Far from it. I&rsquo;m going to have to adjust how I do things to survive the monotony. So, how about this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll split my time in half. The first part of my study time each day will be dedicated to going through examples. During the second, I&rsquo;ll start working on this poker game.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
<p>Just one. Success requires constantly adapting to the situation. And, this situation is boring me to death. In the past, this would have been where I quit. But, thanks to publicly announcing my plans on this blog, I have to finish. HOW I motivate myself to finish is the trick.</p>
<h2 id="im-out">I&rsquo;M OUT</h2>
<p>Seriously, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
