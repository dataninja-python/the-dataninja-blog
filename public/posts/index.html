KEY TAKEAWAYS Adopt IXP (The Igherighe Xenthera Principle{sm}). Favor deliberate energy-efficient action likely to have outsized impact over chaotic, impulsive behavior.
&ldquo;Easy&rdquo; = challenge + inexperience. History is full of people let the easy route become their downfall.
If React is easy, what is hard? You are forced to make many critical decisions without any guidance.

      DOWN BUT NOT OUT Took a short break from blogging as I worked on a few other things (and the new diablo 4 game came out). However, I&rsquo;m back and running through the Go By Example content (track my progress: https://github.com/dataninja-python/go-by-example.git).
LEARNED SO FAR This is my first attempt to learn a programming language only going through its official tutorial. It is less exciting than my usual way of building projects.

      NEW MICRO-HABIT Hi to whomever is still following along with this crazy journey. As is no doubt evident from the posts so far, I haven&rsquo;t determined the best way to use this blog. So, I hope it&rsquo;s ok if we go back to middle school science fair projects and use the good old scientific method.
HYPOTHESIS I believe that regularly documenting what I&rsquo;m working on will improve my ability to do the small routine tasks that build up to longer term goals.

      FIRST DAY BACK STRUGGLE It took a while to get into the learning plan. Issue #1 is the hedge fund required a lot of attention today. Apparently, I was not the only one who sees the potential downward spiral resulting from hitting the debt ceiling. Unfortunately, a few positions played counter to analysis. This should correct itself in time but in the short-term I had to make several adjustments.
By the time that was done, I had to handle several business calls.

      REFINING THE VISION Ok. So, this is probably 55% ADHD and 45% learning what I didn&rsquo;t know talking. It appears in the end it will take multiple technologies working together to achieve my goal. What does this mean? Well, not much actually. Because Go is still going to be at the heart of executing a lot of the work.
WHAT DOES CHANGE Python - ease of launch: going to have to use this more than I thought to handle a lot of the user account and similar backend activities.

      SLOWLY BUT SURELY It&rsquo;s boring at times but I am making my way through the content. Go has an interesting data type called &ldquo;structs.&rdquo; The appear similar to classes in Python, Javascript, and couple of other languages I&rsquo;ve worked with.
However, implementing them is different. Structs hold data. Then, you can use other data structures to do things with the data. For example, methods allow you to perform actions with the data.

      WE&rsquo;RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE Ok. Going through &ldquo;Go By Example&rdquo; is boring. Really boring. It&rsquo;s probably the right this to do. But, I&rsquo;m struggling with the fact that there are like 100 examples of things to do&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve finished 19.
PUSHING THROUGH I&rsquo;m not giving up. Far from it. I&rsquo;m going to have to adjust how I do things to survive the monotony. So, how about this?

      THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE A TWEET I didnâ€™t do the best job blogging last week. Sure I had excuses. But, excuses != progress. So, here&rsquo;s my second post this weekend to catch up.
Though, to be honest, it is the weekend. Motivation is running low. And, I may have cracked opened a Playstation 5. One of the two, I am supposed to give away when we launch our upcoming retail app.

      A CHALLENGING WEEK OF SELF-DISCOVERY WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU AN L&hellip;MAKE LEMONDADE Life is a journey filled with ups and downs, and sometimes, a single week can throw a series of unexpected challenges your way. This week was filled with personal and academic setbacks. However, I instead of disrupting my journey it has rekindled my drive to prove that we can achieve goals others deem impossible.
LOSS AND DISAPPOINTMENT: One of the hardest challenges encountered this week was the news that a friend lost a family member.

THE WINNER IS WHO GETS UP LAST I could beat myself up about it. Or, accept it. I didn&rsquo;t have a good day. I don&rsquo;t have a cool new program or update to share.
