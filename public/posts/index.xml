      <description>THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE A TWEET I didn&amp;rsquo;t do the best job last week of blogging so I had to try to catch up. But, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest its the weekend so my motivation is lacking. Plus, I made the mistake of opening one of the Playstations I was supposed to be giving away during an upcoming app launch&amp;hellip;big mistake.
Anyway, there is something of value to report. I simplified how I&amp;rsquo;m learning Golang.</description>

      <description>A CHALLENGING WEEK OF SELF-DISCOVERY WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU AN L&amp;hellip;MAKE LEMONDADE Life is a journey filled with ups and downs, and sometimes, a single week can throw a series of unexpected challenges your way. This week was filled with personal and academic setbacks. However, I instead of disrupting my journey it has rekindled my drive to prove that we can achieve goals others deem impossible.
LOSS AND DISAPPOINTMENT: One of the hardest challenges encountered this week was the news that a friend lost a family member.</description>

      <description>NOT ONE OF MY FINEST&amp;hellip; What can I say? There are no excuses. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t productive today. To be fair, I DID a lot of stuff. Just didn&amp;rsquo;t spend much time on any of the important stuff long-term.
THE WINNER IS WHO GETS UP LAST I could beat myself up about it. Or, accept it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good day. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a cool new program or update to share.</description>

      <description>TODAY WAS A &amp;lsquo;W&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say I did it. I beat procrastination. I know, I know, it&amp;rsquo;s a miracle. But it&amp;rsquo;s true.
I had a full day of meetings today - usually the perfect excuse to not get anything done. But not today. Today, I won the productivity battle&amp;hellip;we&amp;rsquo;ll see about the war.
THE PLAN Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it:
I got up early (7:30am - it hurt). I put down enough caffeine to kill a baby whale (don&amp;rsquo;t judge).</description>

      <description>THE ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS GOOGLEFU It&amp;rsquo;s official. The internet is trash! Like GARBAGE!
After over two decades spent perfecting the martial art commonly called &amp;ldquo;Googlefu.&amp;rdquo; I seriously thought I could find anything&amp;hellip;in milliseconds…from anywhere.
False! Oh, I know what you’re thinking. ChatGpt or [insert the currently most popular “AI” tool here] would have made quick work of this. Right?
Wrong! (Keep reading to discover why)
So far, the only thing the internet has succeeded at this week - sadly, this is common and why I read books - is helping me find whole new ways to procrastinate.</description>
