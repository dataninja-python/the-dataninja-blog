<p>Hi to whomever is still following along with this crazy journey. As is no doubt evident from the posts so far, I haven&rsquo;t determined the best way to use this blog. So, I hope it&rsquo;s ok if we go back to middle school science fair projects and use the good old scientific method.</p>
<h1 id="hypothesis">HYPOTHESIS</h1>
<p>I believe that regularly documenting what I&rsquo;m working on will improve my ability to do the small routine tasks that build up to longer term goals.</p>
<h1 id="the-experiment">THE EXPERIMENT</h1>
<p>This blog - it turns out - is an excellent way to test my hypothesis. How? Well:</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to write quarterly goals</li>
<li>I need break them down into monthly, weekly, and daily actions</li>
<li>I need to complete the daily actions and revise as needed</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="the-conclusion">THE CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>With this new approach, this blog&rsquo;s purpose becomes clearer: document my goal achieving journey and try to make it entertaining enough for you to read.</p>
<p>Might as well get started.</p>
<h2 id="quarterly-goals">QUARTERLY GOALS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Launch kickseconomy.com</li>
<li>Automate the easiest part of hedge fund management</li>
<li>Prepare myself to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="may-31-2023-actions">MAY 31, 2023 ACTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Finish React coding refresher</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Complete 3 sections of Go By Example tutorial</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Read Chapter 10 of &ldquo;A Linear Algebra Primer for Financial Engineering&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="later">LATER</h1>
<p>Check back this evening to see what I did and what I learned.</p>
