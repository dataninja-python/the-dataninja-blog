<p>I&rsquo;m proud to say I did it. I beat procrastination. I know, I know, it&rsquo;s a miracle. But it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I had a full day of meetings today - usually the perfect excuse to not get anything done. But not today. Today, I won the productivity battle&hellip;we&rsquo;ll see about the war.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">THE PLAN</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I did it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got up early (7:30am - it hurt).</li>
<li>I put down enough caffeine to kill a baby whale (don&rsquo;t judge).</li>
<li>I mixed in building an actual project with my go-by-example tutorial work through.</li>
</ul>
<p>What did I build? My own task manager. (To be fair, it&rsquo;s essentially a clone of a program called Task Warrior - see the end of the post.) It helped me track what I wanted to do and progress.</p>
<p>Well, the caffeine has given me a headache. So, that&rsquo;s it. Another day, I might dive into how I created TaskArchon (cool name?).</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Even a broken watch is right twice a day. There are not enough data points for me to declare victory. But, as Ice Cube said: &ldquo;Today was a good day.&rdquo; I guess just keep trying is the real lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early to rise and early to caffeinate. I attribute 80% of my productivity to Coca-Cola and 20% to getting up at 7:30am. No discussion. I stand by this message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build something. My mentors have both told me this for a while. Well, it turns out experts are&hellip;experts. Having something to build was motivating and helped me feel productive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="im-out">I&rsquo;M OUT!</h2>
<p>See you next time. Same bat place. Probably not the same bat time because I&rsquo;m horrible at keeping routines.</p>
<h3 id="sourceslinks">SOURCES/LINKS</h3>
<p>My ultra-cool task manager go application:
<a href="https://github.com/dataninja-python/my-taskArchon/tree/main">https://github.com/dataninja-python/my-taskArchon/tree/main</a></p>
<p>That other task manager app that was only like 99.9999999999999999999999999999% of the inspiration for mine:
<a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">https://taskwarrior.org/</a></p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t sue me. I&rsquo;m just trying to learn to code.</p>
