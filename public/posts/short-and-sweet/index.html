<p>I didn&rsquo;t do the best job last week of blogging so I had to try to catch up. But, let&rsquo;s be honest its the weekend so my motivation is lacking. Plus, I made the mistake of opening one of the Playstations I was supposed to be giving away during an upcoming app launch&hellip;big mistake.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is something of value to report. I simplified how I&rsquo;m learning Golang. I&rsquo;m going through the gobyexample.com website. Then, I&rsquo;ll make a cool project. I&rsquo;m leaning towards a simple texas hold &rsquo;em console game right now. Let&rsquo;s see if this urge lasts.</p>
<p>To follow along with my version of the examples, here&rsquo;s a link: <a href="https://github.com/dataninja-python/go-by-example.git">https://github.com/dataninja-python/go-by-example.git</a></p>
<h2 id="im-out">I&rsquo;M OUT</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got today. Let&rsquo;s see if I can maintain a better blogging schedule this week. I give it 1.25-to-1 odds. Yeah, ~56% implied probability sounds about right. Obviously, I have hedge fund on the brain but that&rsquo;s a story for another day. Off to play playstation&hellip;I mean rest.</p>
