<p>What can I say? There are no excuses. I just wasn&rsquo;t productive today. To be fair, I DID a lot of stuff. Just didn&rsquo;t spend much time on any of the important stuff long-term.</p>
<h1 id="the-winner-is-who-gets-up-last">THE WINNER IS WHO GETS UP LAST</h1>
<p>I could beat myself up about it. Or, accept it. I didn&rsquo;t have a good day. I don&rsquo;t have a cool new program or update to share. So, here&rsquo;s the plan. Call it a night. Get up early. Try again. Mathematically speaking, if I keep doing that, I have to have another amazing day like yesterday.</p>
<p>NOTE: On a positive note, the fund had a good day. Too bad I didn&rsquo;t advance the skills needed to automate the strategies I&rsquo;m currently employing manually.</p>
<h1 id="key-takeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keep expectations low&hellip;ankle level is best. Yesterday screwed me up. It led me to believe I&rsquo;d be able to bang out a fully functional, usable program in the language I&rsquo;m learning everyday. Not realistic I know. But, that&rsquo;s what I felt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a marathon&hellip;that I&rsquo;m treating like a sprint. The reality is learning things takes time. Why do I think I had to spend four years in college to get a Finance degree, 2 months in a data science bootcamp to pick up the basics, 3 months in a software engineering bootcamp to pick up fullstack development, but I&rsquo;m going to learn a whole new language in a week or two? Not realistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep is the answer. Americans work too much. And, I&rsquo;m guilty of it too. Running the math, I&rsquo;ve been working for ~15 hours. That&rsquo;s not healthy. Time to adopt a more European outlook and seek some work-life balance (until I have another good day and get uber excited again).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="im-out">I&rsquo;M OUT</h1>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m outta here. For all of our sakes, I&rsquo;ve got to get something done tomorrow before I start getting discouraged. Ah, the joys of knowing your ADHD issues&hellip;sucks&hellip;but real. LOL.</p>
<p>NOTE: forgive any typos, poor grammar, etc. Some of it was likely because I had no Fs to give. The rest are because I&rsquo;m tired. If I get time, I&rsquo;ll edit this post another day.</p>
